I found that running adb devices returns an empty list if the device is plugged into a USB hub such as the Atolla USB hub. So plug the device directly into a USB port on the host machine.

Follow these steps [in the Samsung docs](https://www.samsung.com/uk/support/mobile-devices/how-do-i-turn-on-the-developer-options-menu-on-my-samsung-galaxy-device/)

Works great!
